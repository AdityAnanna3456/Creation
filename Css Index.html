   <h1><h1 style="background-color:orangered;"> What is a Software?</h1>
<p>Software is a set of instructions for a computer. The entire set of programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of a computer system is referred to as software. The phrase was coined to distinguish these instructions from the physical components of a computer system, which are known as hardware.The system software is a collection of programs that operate, control, and extend the computer's processing capabilities. The majority of system software is created by the computer makers. These software products are made up of low-level language programs that interact with hardware on a very basic level. The interaction between the hardware and the end users is provided by system software.</p>
